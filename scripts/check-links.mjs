/**
 * Internal documentation link checker.
 *
 * Every page under docs/src/content/docs/ is routed by its file path, so an
 * internal link is resolvable purely from the filesystem — no build, no
 * browser, no network. This gate resolves each one and fails on the misses.
 *
 * Why this exists: on 2026-08-28 a sweep found 68 files' worth of links
 * pointing at challenge briefs that had been archived out from under them,
 * across eighteen briefs and months of archiving. Starlight does not validate
 * internal links, and Astro will happily build and deploy a page full of
 * them, so every one was a silent 404 for anyone who followed it. Nothing in
 * CI could see it: the site built green the entire time.
 *
 * This is deliberately a MECHANICAL check in the sense of the repo's
 * detection-profile rule (root CLAUDE.md § "Why this lives here"): a link
 * either resolves to a file or it does not. It does not judge whether a link
 * is a GOOD link, and it does not check anchors — heading slugs involve
 * enough Starlight-specific normalization that a false positive is likely,
 * and a gate that cries wolf gets ignored.
 *
 * What it checks:
 *   - Markdown links            [text](/crosswalker/...)
 *   - Reference definitions     [ref]: /crosswalker/...
 *   - Inline HTML hrefs         href="/crosswalker/..."   (the docs use
 *                               hand-written HTML/SVG diagrams extensively)
 *   - Both internal spellings: root-absolute `/crosswalker/...` and
 *     site-absolute `https://cybersader.github.io/crosswalker/...`
 *
 * What it skips:
 *   - Fenced and inline code (a link inside an example is not a link)
 *   - External URLs (no network calls — this gate stays offline and fast)
 *   - Anchors and query strings (stripped before resolution)
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run check:links
 *
 * Pass: every internal link resolves to a page file or a public asset.
 * Fail: one or more do not, reported as file:line with the offending target.
