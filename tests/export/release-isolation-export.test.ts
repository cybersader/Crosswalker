/**
 * release-isolation-export.test.ts — coexisting releases must never be silently
 * merged, and a user must be able to tell them apart before overwriting one
 * (2026-08-21, from the release-isolation review).
 *
 * Release isolation lets two versions of the same framework live side by side.
 * That created two new ways to act on the wrong release without knowing it:
 *
 *   1. Export walked a folder tree and stamped ONE header over rows drawn from
 *      both releases, choosing whichever contributed more rows. The file looked
 *      well-formed and misrepresented its own contents.
 *   2. The refresh picker listed sets by their minted id only. Those ids are
 *      deliberately meaningless — that is what makes identity stable — but a
 *      chooser built from them gives a user nothing to choose ON, and choosing
 *      wrong overwrites a release.
