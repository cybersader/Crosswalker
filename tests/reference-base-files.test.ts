/**
 * reference-base-files.test.ts — Phase 3 v0.1.6 unit tests for first-run .base writer.
 *
 * Verifies idempotent first-run write semantics per Settled #2 + #3:
 *   - Creates _crosswalker/views/coverage-matrix.base if missing
 *   - Skips (no overwrite) if file exists (preserves user edits)
 *   - Creates parent folders that don't exist
 *   - Returns the list of paths actually created
 *   - Reference content includes the crosswalker-pivot view declaration
